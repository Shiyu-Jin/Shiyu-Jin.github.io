Iâ€™m a software engineer at Waymo, working on multi-modal large language models for Autonomous Driving. My research interests span robotics and machine learning, with a focus on advancing AI applications in real-world environments.

Before joining Waymo, I worked as a senior robotics researcher for 2 years at Baidu Research. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in December 2021, where I was advised by Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka. During my Ph.D., I had the opportunities to intern at Google X/Intrinsic, MERL, FANUC.
