I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/masayoshi-tomizuka){:target="_blank"}. My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary combination of robotics, optimization, artificial intelligence and control theories with applications to **robotic manipulation** and **motion planning**.

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/files/CV_Changhao.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### Robotic Deformable Object Manipulation

Manipulation of deformable objects is a chal- lenging task for robots. These objects have infinite-dimensional configuration space and are computational-expensive to model, making it difficult for real-time tracking, planning and control. To deal with these challenges, we proposed two different model-free methods: 

- Learning from demonstration based on coherent point drift. \[[paper](/files/rope_framework.pdf){:target="_blank"}\] \[[website](https://me.berkeley.edu/~tetang/RAL2018/RopeManipulation.html){:target="_blank"}\]

- SPR-RWLS for online deformation model approximation. \[paper\] \[[website](https://changhaowang.github.io/IROS2019/SPRRWLS){:target="_blank"}\] \[[presentation](/files/CW_SPR_RWLS_Group_Meeting.pdf){:target="_blank"}\]
